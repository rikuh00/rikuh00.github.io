            <p>As an engineering student, I constantly seek for opportunities 
                to develop my skills in various areas. In particular, I am learning to 
                consider the impact of my designs on society and the 
                environment, and also to communicate my ideas effectively as a professional. This portfolio aims to
                highlight some of my achievements in the Design for the Environment course (MIE315) that I am currently taking.

              <h3>Impacts on Environment and Society</h3>
              <p>To me, accounting for the impact of engineering activities on the environment 
                and the society means that I need to analyze the interactions between my design,
                the environment, and the society as a whole. These are effective engineering practices, since designs need to benefit the users
                and the broader community; whether it is promoting environmental
                sustainability or being aware of the cultural aspects of the particular society,
                being mindful of the impact of engineering will ultimately result in better designs that
                suits the needs of the users.
              </p>
              <p>My long-term lgoal as of now is to become a professional in the financial sector, particularly within Capital Markets.
                While this goal may feel somewhat "far" from environment and society, I think that being able to account for environmental
                and societal impact still goes a long way - for example, Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) is becoming more popular in finance,
                and being aware of the environmental impacts may mean that I can explain this concept better to clients and push for positive changes
                in a field that is traditionally not associated with "eco-friendly" practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, even when working at a financial institution, I
                would constantly "design" new things, such as automation tools and pitch decks. 
                Every time I design something new, I must be aware of the consequences to my workplace and to the client, both of which are just smaller versions
                of "society" that engineers need to be aware of.

              <h3>Communication</h3>
              <p>Communication is an important aspect of engineering.
                For example, engineers are often required to present their recommendations to audience
                with different backgrounds, which means I need to convey my ideas effectively in a way that
                my audience can understand. In addition, engineers often work in teams (both internally and with clients), 
                so communicating in a professional manner is essential to ensuring effective teamwork at workplace. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Communication skills are essential to both my short-term and long-term career goals. For example, getting an 
                internship for Summer 2022 remains my major short-term goal, and this involves networking with professionals; in order to highlight
                my qualifications, I need to be able to communicate my thoughts effectively to employers who may have different backgrounds than my own.
                In addition, my long-term goal is to obtain full-time employment in the financial industry upon graduation; to achieve this goal, it is essential that I achieve excellent performance at my upcoming PEY Co-op at Scotiabank.
                In my PEY co-op, I will have to engage stakeholders across the bank to implement large-scale projects, and this will require communication within my own team to pitch ideas and resolve issues, as well as communication outside of my team to show what I have accomplished.
