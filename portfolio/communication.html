          <p>Communication is integral to the work of engineers; this includes reading and writing reports, giving presentations, and
            liaising with teammates and/or clients (both orally and via written messages). I have developed strong communication skills over
            the past years from coursework, extra-curricular activities, and internships - I am able to communicate effectively via written medium like
            reports and emails in particular. However, I am developing skills to communicate my thoughts in a group setting, particularly when it comes to
            communicating my opinions in difficult situations involving negotiations or conflict resolution. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The entries below demonstrate how I have used my communication skills in the Design for the Environment course.

            <h3>Client Communication</h3>
            <img src="#" class="float-left thumbnail" alt="email">
            <p>As the team leader, I am in charge of communicating with the client via email to set up client meetings and follow up with a meeting summary
              after each meeting. Specifically, my role includes the following tasks:    
            </p>
            <li>
              <ul>Creating and sending a meeting agenda</ul>
              <ul>Liaising with team members to organize talking points during the meeting</ul>
              <ul>Understanding the client's intention and taking notes during the meeting</ul>
              <ul>Promptly sending a meeting summary after each meeting</ul>
            </li>
            <p>
              Throughout the term, the client has been satistified with the team's self-initiative to reach out for questions and sugest ideas to make a better recommendation
              to the client - I believe this is partly because of how the team as a whole has stayed organized during client meetings to deliver information in a concise manner.
              By sending summaries after the meeting, I also help both the client and my team to ensure that both parties are on the same page about the progress of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience allowed me to demonstrate and improve my communication skills, particularly in the context of hosting client meetings and communicating with clients.
              If I end up working in finance as per my career goal, I would be talking to multiple clients in a day to get new deals. As such,
              this aspect of the course directly ties into developing the skills necessary for my future career.

            <img src="img/comm/utwf.jpg" class="float-left thumbnail">
            <p>As the external events director for UofT Women in Finance (UTWF), my main responsibility is
              to organize and execute events that target female STEM students who are interested in a career in finance.
              In this role, I have demonstrated my communication skills by maintaining positive relationships with 3 different
              firms to host a total of 4 events throughout the school year. In order to bring successful events to our members, I
              had to balance the members' needs with the interests of these companies - I did this by clearly communicating our expectations
              upfront but also being open to diffrent suggestions that the firms would bring up.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, I demonstrated my leadership skills by working effectively with 5 other executive members in the club
              to coordinate event schedules and promotions. For example, I worked collaboratively with our promotions director to create a campaign with our
              target audience in mind; this resulted in 150% increase in the event turnout. As a senior member in the club, I also demonstrate my leadership by
              mentoring junior executive members to foster strong relationships with professionals in the financial industry.
