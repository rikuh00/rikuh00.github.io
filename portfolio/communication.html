          <p>Communication is integral to the work of engineers; this includes reading and writing reports, giving presentations, and
            liaising with teammates and/or clients (both orally and via written messages). I have developed strong communication skills over
            the past years from coursework, extra-curricular activities, and internships - I am able to communicate effectively via written medium like
            reports and emails in particular. However, I am developing skills to communicate my thoughts in a group setting, particularly when it comes to
            communicating my opinions in difficult situations involving negotiations or conflict resolution.

            The entries below demonstrate how I have used my communication skills in the Design for the Environment course.

            <img src="img/comm/utwf.jpg" class="float-left thumbnail">
            <p>As the external events director for UofT Women in Finance (UTWF), my main responsibility is
              to organize and execute events that target female STEM students who are interested in a career in finance.
              In this role, I have demonstrated my communication skills by maintaining positive relationships with 3 different
              firms to host a total of 4 events throughout the school year. In order to bring successful events to our members, I
              had to balance the members' needs with the interests of these companies - I did this by clearly communicating our expectations
              upfront but also being open to diffrent suggestions that the firms would bring up.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, I demonstrated my leadership skills by working effectively with 5 other executive members in the club
              to coordinate event schedules and promotions. For example, I worked collaboratively with our promotions director to create a campaign with our
              target audience in mind; this resulted in 150% increase in the event turnout. As a senior member in the club, I also demonstrate my leadership by
              mentoring junior executive members to foster strong relationships with professionals in the financial industry.
