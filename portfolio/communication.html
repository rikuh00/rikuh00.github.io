          <p>Communication is integral to the work of engineers; this includes reading and writing reports, giving presentations, and
            liaising with teammates and/or clients (both orally and via written messages). I have developed strong communication skills over
            the past years from coursework, extra-curricular activities, and internships - I am able to communicate effectively via written medium like
            reports and emails in particular. However, I am developing skills to communicate my thoughts in a group setting, particularly when it comes to
            communicating my opinions in difficult situations involving negotiations or conflict resolution. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The entries below demonstrate how I have used my communication skills in the Design for the Environment course.

            <h3>Client Communication</h3>

              <img src="img/comm/email.png" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="email" style="border:2px solid black; width:90%;">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Email from the client after the first meeting</figcaption>
            </figure>

            
            <p>As the team leader, I am in charge of communicating with the client via email to set up client meetings and follow up with a meeting summary
              after each meeting. Specifically, my role includes the following tasks:    
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating and sending a meeting agenda</li>
              <li>Liaising with team members to organize talking points during the meeting</li>
              <li>Understanding the client's intention and taking notes during the meeting</li>
              <li>Promptly sending a meeting summary after each meeting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Throughout the term, the client has been satistified with the team's self-initiative to reach out for questions and suggest ideas to make a better recommendation
              to the client - I believe this is partly because of how the team as a whole has stayed organized during client meetings to deliver information in a concise manner.
              By sending summaries after the meeting, I also help both the client and my team to ensure that both parties are on the same page about the progress of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience allowed me to demonstrate and improve my communication skills, particularly in the context of hosting client meetings and communicating with clients.
              If I end up working in finance as per my career goal, I would be talking to multiple clients in a day to get new deals. As such,
              this aspect of the course directly ties into developing the skills necessary for my future career.

            <h3>Visualizing Data Using Charts</h3>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>For the term project in the Design for Environment course, my team was tasked with evaluating the environmental impacts of K-Cups and instant
                  coffee, so that the client (Deloitte) can decide which option to use when providing coffee for employees. To communicate our recommendation,
                  we submitted a 7500-word report outlining the environmental, economical, and societal impacts of both alternatives.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  One of my role was to produce high-quality charts and graphics using Python and Excel to communicate the team's findings effectively.
                  My particular area of focus was to visualize the environmental impacts in a way that enhanced the team's argument to recommend instant coffee over K-Cups.
                  This experience taught me a few things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I learned how to choose the best type of visualization based on the goal of the project.</li>
                  <li>I learned how to explore unorganized datasets to find meaningful information that could be visualized to strengthen the team's argument.</li>
                  <li>When coding visualization tools in Python, I learned best practices for commenting and writing my code so that other people can understand what I am trying to accomplish.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Overall, I have demonstrated my ability to communicate quantitative information in an effective manner using charts and other visualizations.
                  This experience will directly tie to my upcoming PEY Co-op at Scotiabank, where I will be responsible for creating data dashboards to display insightful information so that
                  senior stakeholders can make important business decisions. While the work I took on in this project is much smaller in scale than what I would work on as a co-op,
                  a lot of the lessons learned can be carried over so that I can make a significant contribution on my team.
