          <p>As engineers, it is important to analyze the societal and environmental impacts of engineering designs.
            Throughout the Design for the Environment course, I have learned some tools to analyze both the environmental and societal
            impacts of different projects; this includes ISO-compliant Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as well as different tools and guidelines to assess
            the societal and economical impacts.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I have demonstrated my basic ability to account for environmental and societal impacts through coursework, I still have to improve my skills
            in this field in order to fully account for the outcomes of my activities as an engineer. However, I am interested in designs that minimize environmental impacts
            and promote sustainability - for example, I was a part of Carbon Cutting Racers Design Team, where we designed fuel-efficient cars out of carbon fibers.
            Although my career aspirations does not necessarily involve a lot of engineering designs, I would still like to pursue my interest in sustainable technologies
            that can be used to mitigate negative environmental and societal impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entries below demonstrate how I have demonstrated my ability to account for environmental and societal impacts, particularly within the context of the Design for the Environment course.

            <h3>Client Communication</h3>

            </figure>

            
            <p>As the team leader, I am in charge of communicating with the client via email to set up client meetings and follow up with a meeting summary
              after each meeting. Specifically, my role includes the following tasks:    
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating and sending a meeting agenda</li>
              <li>Liaising with team members to organize talking points during the meeting</li>
              <li>Understanding the client's intention and taking notes during the meeting</li>
              <li>Promptly sending a meeting summary after each meeting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Throughout the term, the client has been satistified with the team's self-initiative to reach out for questions and sugest ideas to make a better recommendation
              to the client - I believe this is partly because of how the team as a whole has stayed organized during client meetings to deliver information in a concise manner.
              By sending summaries after the meeting, I also help both the client and my team to ensure that both parties are on the same page about the progress of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience allowed me to demonstrate and improve my communication skills, particularly in the context of hosting client meetings and communicating with clients.
              If I end up working in finance as per my career goal, I would be talking to multiple clients in a day to get new deals. As such,
              this aspect of the course directly ties into developing the skills necessary for my future career.

            <p>For the term project in the Design for Environment course, my team was tasked with evaluating the environmental impacts of K-Cups and instant
              coffee, so that the client (Deloitte) can decide which option to use when providing coffee for employees and guests. To communicate our recommendation,
              we submitted a 7500-word report outlining the environmental, economical, and societal impacts of both alternatives.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of my role was to produce high-quality charts and graphics using Python and Excel to communicate the team's findings effectively.
              My particular area of focus was to visualize the environmental impacts in a way that enhanced the team's argument to recommend instant coffee over K-Cups.
              This experience taught me a few things:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I learned how to choose the best type of visualization based on the goal of the project.</li>
              <li>I learned how to explore unorganized datasets to find meaningful information that could be visualized to strengthen the team's argument.</li>
              <li>When coding visualization tools in Python, I learned best practices for commenting and writing my code so that other people can understand what I am trying to accomplish.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This experience will directly tie to my upcoming PEY Co-op at Scotiabank, where I will be responsible for creating data dashboards to display insightful information so that
              senior stakeholders can make important business decisions. While the work I took on in this project is a lot smaller in scale than what I would actually do at work,
              a lot of the lessons learned can be carried over so that I can make a significant contribution on my team.

            <img src="img/comm/utwf.jpg" class="float-left thumbnail">
            <p>As the external events director for UofT Women in Finance (UTWF), my main responsibility is
              to organize and execute events that target female STEM students who are interested in a career in finance.
              In this role, I have demonstrated my communication skills by maintaining positive relationships with 3 different
              firms to host a total of 4 events throughout the school year. In order to bring successful events to our members, I
              had to balance the members' needs with the interests of these companies - I did this by clearly communicating our expectations
              upfront but also being open to diffrent suggestions that the firms would bring up.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, I demonstrated my leadership skills by working effectively with 5 other executive members in the club
              to coordinate event schedules and promotions. For example, I worked collaboratively with our promotions director to create a campaign with our
              target audience in mind; this resulted in 150% increase in the event turnout. As a senior member in the club, I also demonstrate my leadership by
              mentoring junior executive members to foster strong relationships with professionals in the financial industry.
