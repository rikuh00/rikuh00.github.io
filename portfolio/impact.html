          <p>As engineers, it is important to analyze the societal and environmental impacts of engineering designs.
            Throughout the Design for the Environment course, I have learned some tools to analyze both the environmental and societal
            impacts of different projects; this includes ISO-compliant Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as well as different tools and guidelines to assess
            the societal and economical impacts.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I have demonstrated my basic ability to account for environmental and societal impacts through coursework, I still have to improve my skills
            in this field in order to fully account for the outcomes of my activities as an engineer. However, I am interested in designs that minimize environmental impacts
            and promote sustainability - for example, I was a part of Carbon Cutting Racers Design Team, where we designed fuel-efficient cars out of carbon fibers.
            Although my career aspirations does not necessarily involve a lot of engineering designs, I would still like to pursue my interest in sustainable technologies
            that can be used to mitigate negative environmental and societal impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entries below demonstrate how I have demonstrated my ability to account for environmental impacts, particularly within the context of the Design for the Environment course.

            <h3>Streamed Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA)</h3>

            <figure class="figure mx-auto d-block">

            </figure>
            <p>As part of the term project for the Design for the Environment course, my team analyzed the environmental impacts of K-Cups and instant coffee
              so that our client (Deloitte) can choose an appropriate option for providing coffee to its employees. To make a preliminary recommendation, we conducted a streamlined
              life cycle assessment (SLCA), which uses a matrix for qualitative assessments of environmental impacts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To properly perform SLCA, I obtained data about emissions and residues from research papers and relevant databases online. I also used tools like
              Solidworks to model coffee products; this allowed the team to understand how much material was used for product packaging. Additionally, I wrote the relevant section
              of the recommendation report to explain the environmental impacts and justify why instant coffee has a lower impact relative to K-Cups.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this experience, I learned how to evaluate environmental impacts of projects qualitatively given limited data. I also demonstrated my ability to consider environmental
              impacts at all stages of the lifecycle; in particular, I conducted detailed research to demonstrate that the environmental impacts are highly sensitive to consumer behaviour.
              This improved the quality of our project since the client could now take actions to encourage sustainable consumer behaviour, in addition to choosing a more environmentally-friendly option.

            <h3>Hybrid LCA</h3>
            <figure class="figure float-right">
              <img src="img/impacts/hybrid.png" class="figure-img" alt="graph" style="border:2px solid black; margin-left:8px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Chart demonstrating the environmental impacts</figcaption>
            </figure>

            
            <p>To build upon the qualitative assessment of environmental impacts using SLCA, my team also conducted a hybrid LCA to quantify the impacts of both K-Cups and instnat coffee.
              I was responsible for the entire process of hybrid LCA, including finding datasets, estimating and/or calculating the amount of inputs and outputs, and performing an impact analysis to 
              determine which alternative has a higher environmental impact.
            </p>

            <p>
              To perform the LCA and impact assessment, I learned how to use the openLCA software to perform the following tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating custom flows in the database to represent different products such as coffee, K-Cups, and instant coffee</li>
              <li>Connecting different processes in the database to produce a system that contains all inputs and outputs</li>
              <li>Performing impact analysis using TRACI and analyzing the data to identify which "stages" in the life cycle have more emissions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Ultimately, I learned how to use the openLCA software to perform LCA and quantify the environmental impacts of different projects. Similar to the SLCA,
              my work allowed the team to recommend actionable items for clients so that they can mitigate the negative environmental impacts; this shows that I am able to
              analyze and improve projects with environmental considerations in mind.
